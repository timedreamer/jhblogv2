This is my Hugo blog using [hugo-PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod).

## Local development (WSL2 + VS Code)

- `hugo server -D` to run a local preview including drafts.
- `hugo` to build the production site into `public/`.

## Deployment

Workflow:
1. Develop and preview locally in WSL2.
2. Commit and push to GitHub.
3. Netlify builds and deploys from GitHub.
