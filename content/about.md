![My bio picture](/images/my-bio.png)

My name is Ji Huang. I'm a post-doc at [Dr. Gloria Coruzzi lab][7] at NYU. I did my PhD in [Dr. Karen McGinnis][1] lab at Florida State University. I got my Bachelor degree in biological science from [Huazhong Agricultural University][5], China.

My primary research interest is to uncover plant gene regulatory mechanisms using high-throughput omics data, statistics, and machine learning methods. Coupled with advanced gene editing techniques, I hope to translate the basic discoveries to practical outcomes in the field, such as developing crop varieties with superior nitrogen and water usage under the marginal soils.
