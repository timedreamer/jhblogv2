For my gene network projects, a majority of my time was spent on manually curate RNA-Seq data on SRA, download SRA data and align them on the maize genome. This week I found an API or resouece from EMBL, [RNASeq-er API][1] that already alligned RNA-Seq reads on genome for you. 

The paper ([The RNASeq-er API—a gateway to systematically updated analysis of public RNA-seq data][5] was published on Bioinformatics, 2017.

This post is to show how to do some basic search and download using the API. I followed steps on API's [document][1].


# 1. What is RNASeq-er?

RNASeq-er is an API that allow users to download processed RNA-Seq files, including meta-data, cram and processed gene experssion data. It uses [iRAP pipeline][2]. It uses TopHat2 and HTSeq2/DEXSeq based on Ensemble genome assembly. See below flowchat.

# 2. Usage exmples

Here I will use maize RNA-Seq study **[SRP047420][4]** as an example. This study was published by Gent et al 2014 [Plant Cell paper][3]. It contains 6 RNA-Seq libraries, mop1-wt vs mop1-mut. Based on the information, all sequences were aligned to AGPv4.

## 2.1 How many plant species in the database?

You can run `wget` or `curl` in Linux console to download the table, or just use plain **http** and search in Chrome as I did.

**https://www.ebi.ac.uk/fg/rnaseq/api/tsv/0/getOrganisms/plants**

The result is like below, you will get a tsv table with a) Taxomic name of the organism and b) name of the organism used as reference genome. The `/0` in the url is the minimum percentage of reads mapped to the reference genome.

## 2.2 Sample meta-data for one study.

You can get the meta-data for one study by searchinng: **https://www.ebi.ac.uk/fg/rnaseq/api/tsv/getSampleAttributesPerRunByStudy/SRP047420**

But, I found it's not very easy to extract useful information. Maybe JSON format will be better.

## 2.3 Alignment files for one study

```shell
wget https://www.ebi.ac.uk/fg/rnaseq/api/tsv/70/getRunsByStudy/SRP047420
```

You will get Sample IDs, Mapping quality, genome version and download files FTP address (including cram, bedgraph and bigwig format).

Actually, if you go to the FTP site of one library, for example SRR1583909, there are all files downloadable. These files include gene/transcript level expression, exon level expression, kallisto result and quality control result.

## 2.4 Alignment files for one organism

You can get FTP addresses for all aligned files for one organism (at 70% aligned on genome).

```shell
wget https://www.ebi.ac.uk/fg/rnaseq/api/tsv/70/getRunsByOrganism/zea_mays
```

On 2018-02-09, there all 7147 libraries in maize that have been processed. The last line did not have `LF`, so if use `wc -l`, there was one line less.

## 2.5 Gene expression data for one study.

To get gene expresion data for one study:

Search: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/fg/rnaseq/api/tsv/getStudy/SRP047420

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/yEOZX8o.jpg)

You can also find other types of gene expression data from the FTP site (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/arrayexpress/data/atlas/rnaseq/studies/ena/SRP047420/zea_mays)

p
## 2.6 Gene expression data for one organism.

You can also get all gene expression files for one specific organism, for example **zea_mays**. I did not see kallisto result in the table, but you can download based on the FTP from 2.2.

```shell
wget https://www.ebi.ac.uk/fg/rnaseq/api/tsv/getStudiesByOrganism/zea_mays
```

In total there are **661** studies in maize.

## 2.7 Mapping quality for all organisms

Search: **https://www.ebi.ac.uk/fg/rnaseq/api/tsv/getOrganismsMappingQuality**


# 3. Summary

I think this is awesome that EBI already processed the gene expression data FOR YOU! The only thing that can improve is to use HISAT2/STAR instead of TopHat2, since TopHat is out-dated.
