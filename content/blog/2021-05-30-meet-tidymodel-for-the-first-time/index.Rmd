I've known the `tidymodel` framework for a while, but never tried it. [Tidymodel](https://www.tidymodels.org/) is the new framework from *Max Kuhn*, the author of `caret` framework in R. In the past week, I read the [Tidy Modeling with R](https://www.tmwr.org/) book and tried `tidymodel` system for the first time.

In this post, I fit a random forest model for a classification problem using `tidymodel`. Just a quick first try of this new system.



## 1. Load dataset

The dataset is from `sda` [package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sda/index.html). There is a dataset `singh2002` that includes *Gene expression data (6033 genes for 102 samples) from the microarray study of Singh et al. (2002).*.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidymodels)
library(sda)

tidymodels_prefer()

data(singh2002)
```

For quick processing, I just keep the first 100 genes in the model. The dataset consists 102 samples, 52 cancer and 50 healthy samples. 

```{r}
gexpr <- tibble(as.data.frame(singh2002$x))
gexpr$label <- singh2002$y
gexpr <- select(gexpr, label, V1:V100)
```

```{r}
table(gexpr$label)
```


## 2. Build Random Forest model

### 2.1 Split dataset

```{r}
set.seed(123)
gexpr_split <- initial_split(gexpr, strata = label)
gexpr_train <- training(gexpr_split)
gexpr_test <- testing(gexpr_split)
```

### 2.2 Create Cross-Validation set

```{r}
set.seed(234)
gexpr_folds <- vfold_cv(gexpr_train, strata = label)
gexpr_folds
```

### 2.3 Receipes

The [usemodels] package helps to *quickly create code snippets to fit models using the tidymodels framework.*

```{r}
usemodels::use_ranger(label ~ ., data = gexpr_train)
```

```{r}
ranger_recipe <-
    recipe(formula = label ~ ., data = gexpr_train)
```

### 2.4 Model specification

```{r}
ranger_spec <-
    rand_forest(trees = 1000) %>%
    set_mode("classification") %>%
    set_engine("ranger")
```


### 2.5 Workflow

```{r}
ranger_workflow <-
    workflow() %>%
    add_recipe(ranger_recipe) %>%
    add_model(ranger_spec)
```


### 2.6 Fit CV training set

```{r}
doParallel::registerDoParallel()
set.seed(12345)
ranger_rs <-
    fit_resamples(ranger_workflow,
                  resamples = gexpr_folds,
                  control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)
    )

```

### 2.7 Check Training Performance

10-fold CV summary

```{r}
collect_metrics(ranger_rs, summarize = TRUE)
```
Performance of each fold

```{r}
collect_metrics(ranger_rs, summarize = FALSE)
```

Plot the 10 fold ROC, but most of them have AUC=1.

```{r}
collect_predictions(ranger_rs) %>%
    group_by(id) %>%
    roc_curve(label, .pred_cancer) %>%
    autoplot()

```

Averaged confusion matrix.

```{r}
conf_mat_resampled(ranger_rs, tidy = FALSE) %>%
    autoplot()
```

### 2.8 Fit Testing set

```{r}
final_fitted <- last_fit(ranger_workflow, gexpr_split)
collect_metrics(final_fitted) 
```

### 2.9 Check Testing set Performance

```{r}
collect_metrics(final_fitted)
```
All 26 samples were correct.

```{r}
collect_predictions(final_fitted) %>%
    conf_mat(label, .pred_class)
```

The confusion matrix plot is a little confusing. It looks like there are incorrect classfication, while the model predicts all 26 samples correctly.

```{r}
collect_predictions(final_fitted) %>%
    conf_mat(label, .pred_class) %>%
    autoplot()
```

## 3. Extra

Some things I didn't cover in this post.

1. Tuning models using [tune](https://github.com/tidymodels/tune) package
2. Comparing models.

Useful links:

1. [Julia Silge](https://juliasilge.com/blog/)'s Blogs.
2. [Jan Kirenz](https://www.kirenz.com/post/2020-12-19-r-tidymodels-housing/) posts.
3. [Tidy Modeling with R](https://www.tmwr.org/) Book.

Some thoughts on tidymodel:

The tidymodel ecosystem looks like a solid platform for modeling building and testing in R. I like it has so many modules that can cover almost all statistical models. For time-series data, use [tidyverts](https://tidyverts.org/).

However, because of tidymodel's modularity, it contains so many packages and so many functions. It does not offer an all-in-one system like `caret` (and it will probably never be). 

I also have concerns on tidymodel on speed and memory usage. Anyway the tidymodel is definitely an interesting modeling system. I will try it more using my real research problems.
