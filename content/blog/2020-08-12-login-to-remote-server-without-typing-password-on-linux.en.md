The method is very similar with Windows machine, but much easier, just two steps. The key is `ssh-keygen`. This works with WSL also.

Update: 2021-02-03


### 1. Generate local SSH key.

```shell
ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/td/.ssh/id_rsa): /home/td/.ssh/ID_NAME_HERE
```

### 2. Copy the key to the remote server.

```shell
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/ID_NAME_HERE.pub your@remote.server
```

### 3. login to the remote server from terminal

```shell
ssh -i ~/.ssh/ID_NAME_HERE your@remote.server
```
